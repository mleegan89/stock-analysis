# Stock Analysis - VBA Module 2 Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of this project was to allow Steve to quickly and efficiently analyze the performance of different stocks over the period of 2017 and 2018. By using certain tools in VBA, specifically For Loops and If-Then statements, we were able to create a macro allowing for the analysis to not only compute results but project the results in an easy to read colored format. When conducting this analysis we formatted our VBA script into two different versions, - "Original" and "Refactored", to determine which would be the quickest. 

### Data Provided To Conduct Task
In order to conduct this analysis we were given an excel file with the performance of 12 different stocks in 2017 and 2018. The different values/data included were the stock's ticker, daily volume traded, opening price, closing price, high price, and low price. 

## Results 
In the year 2017 every stock but "TERP" performed positivley vs 2018 when only two stocks "ENPH" and "RUN" performed positively. These computed results were not impacted by the different versions of the code that were used.

When we measured the performance of our refactored VBA script we used the code ran at 0.0895 secs. Below are screenshots of the speed and refactored code.

When taking a look at the speed of the original code (shown below) it is easy to see the refactored code performed at a measurably quicker speed. Below are the times in which the original code was completed as well as the original code.

## Summary
While assuming our orginal code was correct, we may have run into errors or additional complications when trying to refactor our code. In some cases there may only be one solution that quickly/effeciently helps complete the task we have been given. The obvious advantages of refactoring code, especially when working with teams, is that we open ourselves up to listen to how another individual may have solved the task. The more we hear other peoples' ideas and solutions the better we will become at this as the time goes on. In this specific example the advantage of our refactored VBA code was easy to see - quicker speed to completion.
